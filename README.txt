I think someone would be interested to build a Sierpinsky triangle on python. So I wrote a code that builds it using the "Pygame" library. Perhaps here are various mistakes that I could admit (since I am a beginner in the Python language). But perhaps someone it is interesting and can help.

What to do if you do not have a Pegame library installed?
1. Press "Win+r".
2.Please write cmd.
3. Insert "pip install pygame".
4.Check out.
5.Well done.
